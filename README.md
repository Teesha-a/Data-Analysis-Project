# Udemy Courses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Udemy courses. The analysis aims to extract insights related to course offerings, pricing models, subscriber counts, and course popularity based on different factors such as subject categories, levels, and pricing models (free/paid).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about Udemy courses, including:
- Course title
- Subject category
- Pricing (free/paid)
- Number of subscribers
- Learning level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, All Levels)

## Features of the Project
1. **Dataset Overview**
   - Displaying dataset information (columns, rows, memory usage)
   - Checking for missing and duplicate values
   - Removing duplicate entries

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Number of courses per subject
   - Number of courses per learning level
   - Proportion of free vs. paid courses
   - Courses with the highest number of subscribers
   - Most and least popular courses
   - Number of courses related to Python

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Bar charts for course distribution by subject and level
   - Pie charts for free vs. paid courses and subscriber distribution
   - Horizontal bar charts for the most popular courses
